Hi, my name is **Ren√© Mellema** and I'm a student at the 
[University of Groningen][RUG], following the [BSc Artificial Intelligence]
[RUGAI] programme. I've got an interest in programming, cognitive psychology
and natural language processing.

On this blog I will write about things that I find fascinating or that keep 
me up at night. It will probably also include posts about the 
[projects][projects] that I work on.

I have experience with [Lua][], [Python][], [R][], [C][], [Java][] and [Matlab][]/[Octave][].
Currently, I'm trying to learn [Common Lisp][CL], just for fun. 

You can find me on [github][] or [linkedin][]. I'm also on [twitter][], but
I rarely tweet. The easiest way to reach is probably using [email][].
