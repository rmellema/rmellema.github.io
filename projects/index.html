This is a list with all my projects and a short description. And maybe a longer description if I can get around to writing one.

<hr />

<ul class="posts">
  {% for project in site.data.projects %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ project.link }}"><h1>{{ project.name }}</h1></a>
      {{ project.short }}
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
