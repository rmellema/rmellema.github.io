Welcome to my new blog! I just uploaded this website, which is the default 
Jekyll layout with a few changes. The sources can be found on my github 
acount, and there is a lot I still need to fix. For example, there is only
one style for all the navbar like constructs, which is kinda ugly.

Ayway, introductions. My name is Ren√© Mellema, and I'm a student of the 
Bachelor Artificial Intelligence at the Universtity of Groningen. I hope 
to finish this study in July, so I can start with the Masters programma in 
September. 

On this blog I will probably write about my projects, which can be in Lua, 
Python, Haskell, C, Java or Common Lisp, depending on the task and the 
language I fell like using. The projects will probably be related to my 
courses or tools that I require for whatever I'm doing now. 

I hope you enjoy reading my blog, and if you have any comments or remarks, 
feel free to contact me! Contact details can be found in the footer of 
this website.
